# A-Decision-Tree-Optimised-SVM-Model-for-Stress-Detection-using-Biosignals-Implementation

## Overview
This project involves the implementation of the research paper 'A Decision Tree Optimised SVM Model for Stress Detection using Biosignals' by Alana Paul Cruz, Aravind Pradeep, Kavali Riya Sivasankar and Krishnaveni K.S.
A machine learning model is proposed based on human bio signals to detect human stress. ECG is used as the bio signal and its features (RR, QT and EDR intervals) are extracted to train and test on models based on Cubic SVM and Decision Tree Optimized SVM to increase the accuracy of stress prediction.

## Dataset
The database “drivedb” [Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers] is used which was taken from the website Physionet.

## Requirements
To set up the environment, you'll need to install all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`. 

### Installation Steps:
1. Clone or download the repository with the notebook file.
2. Install the necessary Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file

### Running the Notebook:
1. After installing the dependencies, open the Jupyter notebook.
2. Execute each cell sequentially to reproduce the results. The notebook includes sections for:
   - Installing packages
   - Importing necessary libraries
   - Processing and analyzing the dataset
   - Generating plots and tables.
